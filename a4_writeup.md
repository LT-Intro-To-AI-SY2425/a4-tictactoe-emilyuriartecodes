# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?

The most difficult part was understanding the check format for the tic-tac-toe table. The writing of this part of the secion of the program was very unfamiliar to me and I didn't understand some of the variables.

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.

I would gather information on how the main patterns of tic tac toe are and then feed that infor to AI as a computer player. 

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

I would use AI because of it's capabilities to self-learn from its mistakes. Implementing a minimax algorithim is also a way to have Ai  always play at the best of its abilities.
